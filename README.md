Requests by zeeto

Both requests are present in zeeto ipynb, running all the cells would create the requested json files (One oriented by records and another orientes by columns), create a database and run the query for creating the table of question 2.

Kindly let me know of all your suggestions and comments about this.


Requirements: 
1) zeeto2.csv 
2) zeeto.ipynb 
instructions: 
1) Run zeeto.ipynb cell by cell or all at once. 

SQL query:


SELECT r.campaign_name, r.visits, r.impressions, i.last_impressed_at_pst, r.conversions, c.last_converted_at_pst, tr.total_revenue

FROM 
(SELECT campaign_name, 
count(CASE event_type WHEN 'visit_created' THEN 1 END) as visits,
count(CASE event_type WHEN 'campaign_impressed' THEN 1 END) as impressions, 
count(CASE event_type WHEN 'campaign_converted' THEN 1 END) as conversions from raw_campaign_events group by campaign_name) r 

LEFT join 
(SELECT campaign_name, MAX(datetime(timestamp_utc||'+08:00')) as last_impressed_at_pst FROM raw_campaign_events where event_type = 'campaign_impressed' group by campaign_name,event_type) i
on r.campaign_name = i.campaign_name

LEFT join 
(SELECT campaign_name, MAX(datetime(timestamp_utc||'+08:00')) as last_converted_at_pst FROM raw_campaign_events where event_type = 'campaign_converted' group by campaign_name,event_type) c
on r.campaign_name = c.campaign_name

LEFT JOIN
(SELECT campaign_name, sum(revenue) as total_revenue FROM raw_campaign_events where event_type = 'campaign_converted' group by campaign_name) tr
on r.campaign_name = tr.campaign_name

group by r.campaign_name;
